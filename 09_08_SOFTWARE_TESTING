  - Integration: The components are testing together within the system or software to verify that everything works correctly with each other. 
  - User Acceptence: determining if the system satisfies the customer's needs/ Usually on-premise before the system/software is shipped or transfered to the costumer. 
  - Alpha: The software/system is release to those within the company or organizaition who are not specifically involvd in the development or implementation of the product. 
  - Beta: the software system is available to the public.The most realistic testing data a company or organization can get before the product is fully available.""")

  - At the Limits:  a pair of values at each end of a range. The data at the upper or lower limits of expectations that should be accepted. The immediate values before or beyond the limits of expectations that should be rejected. 
  - Extreme: Testing data at the upper or lower limits of expectations that should be accepted by the system.
