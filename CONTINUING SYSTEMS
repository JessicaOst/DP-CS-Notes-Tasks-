  print("""It is a switch from one system to another. The larger the environment, the more complicated and problematic a switch will be. those like a medical facility, power plant or communication provider that handle peoples livelyhood, health and wellness or infrastructure. It can be considered a system or proccess which a company relies on. It can be a new system implemented into an already established larger system. 
  Sometimes it's met with consumer or employee resistance. It is best to plan ahead of time to avoid these challenges.
  These are a few implementation methods:
  - Parallel: both systems work at the dame time allowing meausring the output of the new system before getting rid of the old one. The downfalls to this method is that it can be far more expensive because it might take additional man hours, additional computer/network resources; and if the systems are drastically different this can be extremely ineffecient.
  - Big Bang/Direct/Immediate: As soon as implementations are made, the new system is discontinued. It is the least taxing on computer and network systems, but it requires extensive training and a teritary system to store date while the changeover occurs. 
  - Pilot: Common with bigger organizations that have multiple sites. This allows the company to to test out the new system and fix issues without taking on such a great risk. Once they believe it is successful enough to implement it to their other sites they are able to use the pilot group as a model.
  - Phased: When the new system is implemented in phases. Usually means that the systems have to be alike to facilitate the transition of date from one system to another. Training is extended and take a long time to completely phased out. The phases can be based on certain proccesses, functions, or departments. """)

If these things aren't done corrrectly we're looking at poor yser adaption, post go live disruption, delayed projects, and overall just turns more expensive. 
  Date quality really is the main point of data migration, you're looking at the business processes, how to structure the data and make sure the buisness runs in the most effecient way possible. """)

  - Horizontal: two companies that sell the same product/service come together. They have different costumer bases (HP and Compaq)

  - Concentric: two companies with two different products and service, but with the same costumer base. Driven by cross-selling growing the top-line. Difficult.

  - Select the best system from each and merge them. Providing familiarity for employees. Takes time to adjust because to operating by habit in some parts. 
  - select the better of the two systems and drop the other system entirely. Possible resistance to change and policy issues. """)
